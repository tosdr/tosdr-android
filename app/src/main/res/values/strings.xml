    <string name="about_organization_desc1">\"Terms of Service; Didn\'t Read\" (short: ToS;DR) is a young project started in June 2012 to help fix the \"biggest lie on the web\": almost no one really reads the terms of service we agree to all the time. We aim at rating popular web services Terms of Service and Privacy Policies by summarizing them in \"convenient\" grades from A to E with so called \"Points\".</string>
    <string name="about_organization_desc2">ToS;DR is a non-profit organization, and all of our team members and contributors do their work as volunteers, with payment being rare. We rely on donations to keep our infrastructure and operations up, and our finances are laid out through our website and collective websites.</string>

    <string name="points_grade_b">Services with many great points and some negative ones should be classified as an B</string>
